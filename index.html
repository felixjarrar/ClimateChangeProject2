					<p>Nitrogen oxides are a group of seven gases and compounds composed of nitrogen and oxygen, sometimes collectively known as NOx gases.  The two most common and hazardous oxides of nitrogen are nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide. 
					Nitrous oxide, commonly called laughing gas, is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Nitrogen oxide pollution is emitted from vehicle exhaust, and the burning of coal, oil, diesel fuel, and natural gas, especially from electric power plants. 
					They are also emitted by cigarettes, gas stoves, kerosene heaters, wood burning, and silos that contain silage.
					Nitrogen oxides can create environmental health hazards when they react with sunlight and other chemicals to form smog. 
					Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide react with substances in the atmosphere to form acid rain. Nitrogen dioxide is used to produce rocket fuels and explosives.
					Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial activities, and during combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste.  
					Additionally, it is used as an anesthetic.</p>
					<p>The bar chart describes the maximum measurement of nitrous oxide emission from 1970 to 2012 for the selected ten countries. We picked the 25th country from a total of 255 countries. 
					The two scatter plots describe nitrous oxide emission level (1970 - 2012) for India and the United States.  </p>

				<p>New York’s climate is changing. Most of the state has warmed one to three degrees (F) in the last century, heavy rainstorms are more frequent, and the sea is rising about one inch every decade. Higher water levels are eroding beaches, submerging low lands, and exacerbating coastal flooding. In the coming decades, changing the climate is likely to increase coastal and inland flooding, disrupt farming and winter recreation, and increase some risks to human health. 
					Our climate is changing because the earth is warming. People have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the air by 40 percent since the late 1700s. Other heat trapping greenhouse gases are also increasing. These gases have warmed the surface and lower atmosphere of our planet about one degree during the last 50 years. Evaporation increases as the atmosphere warms, which increases humidity, average rainfall, and the frequency of heavy rainstorms in many places—but contributes to drought in others
					Greenhouse gases are also changing the world’s oceans and ice cover. Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, so the oceans are becoming more acidic. The surface of the ocean has warmed about one degree during the last 80 years. Warming is causing snow to melt earlier in spring, and mountain glaciers are retreating. Even the great ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are shrinking. Thus the sea is rising at an increasing rate.</p>
					<p>This graph uses daily temperature of NYC as an example. If there is any changes of temperature on a daily basis, then it could be an indication of climate change on a global scale. </p>
