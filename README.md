# ClimateChangeProject2
We will start by showing NYC daily temperature changes in 2016. From this example, we wanted to explain the magniture of the climate change problem and its impact. 
We will then take a step back and show the effects of climate changes in the globe from a few factors, such as carbon dioxide emissions, global average temperature changes, and sea level changes.
